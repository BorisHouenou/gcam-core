#' Calculate the fraction of electricity generation by fuel by horizontal load segment in 2010 such that
#' the total supply of electricity in each grid region matches total demand of electricity in that grid.
#'
#' @param command API command to execute
#' @param ... other optional parameters, depending on command
#' @return Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,

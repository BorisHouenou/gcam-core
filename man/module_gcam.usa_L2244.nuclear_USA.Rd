\value{
Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all

\description{
Generates an add-on file to update nuclear assumptions in GCAM-USA.
}
\details{
This chunk creates an add-on file to update nuclear assumptions in GCAM-USA. Specifically, it reads in state-specific
s-curve retirement functions and lifetimes for existing nuclear vintage based on data put together by Dr. Son H. Kim.
The data reflect planned retirements by state and nuclear power plant. Further, the script updates share-weight assumptions for Gen 3 technology.
It assumes that no new nuclear is deployed in any state through 2035, except in GA, based on current understanding. It does not update
subsector share-weight assumptions in this add-on.

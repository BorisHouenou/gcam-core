module_gcam.usa_LB1237.elec_load_segments_solver_2005_USA(command, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{command}{API command to execute}

\item{...}{other optional parameters, depending on command}
}
\value{
Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
the generated outputs: \code{L1237.grid_elec_supply_USA}, \code{L1237.grid_elec_demand_USA}, \code{L1237.grid_check_USA}.

The corresponding file in the original data system was \code{LB1237.elec_load_segments_solver_2005.R} (gcam-usa level1).
